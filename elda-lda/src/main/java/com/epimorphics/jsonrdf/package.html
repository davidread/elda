The <b>jsonrdf</b> package provides serialisation of RDF models into
JSON. The serialisation streams so in principle a servlet (or other
client) does not need to store the complete serialised result.
(However Elda does not currently support streamed output: all
renderings are materialised into Strings before being sent to
the client.)
