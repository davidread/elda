Elda 1.3.13 was released on May 22th 2015. It supersedes 1.3.12.

The (obsolete, non-working) built-in HTML renderer has been
removed. An HTML renderer must be explicitly specified for the
API or its endpoints. 

The internal Elda cache is now keyed on the request URI with
the format (specified as .format or &format=format) stripped;
hence different formats for the "same" endpoint share the cache
entry. The metatdata in the response is now regenerated not
cached.
